cloudfrl.com is located in The Netherlands, but we target a worldwide audience. 
The 'frl' in CloudFRL is actually an abreviation for Frysl√¢n, a province in the Northern part of the country. 

Please be aware that cloudfrl.com is just getting started and isn't serving to huge audience yet. 
However, you could make the difference. If you found one of our articles helpful or simply just enjoyed in, please share it with your friends, relatives and/or colleagues.
